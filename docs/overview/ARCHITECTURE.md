# Architecture

## Project Identity

Stakka is an iOS astrophotography application designed for stargazing enthusiasts. It combines three core capabilities:

1. **Light pollution mapping** — Find dark sky locations
2. **Multi-exposure capture** — Automated stacking photography
3. **Library stacking** — Process existing photos

The app follows iOS-native design first. Stakka's visual identity is a
thin astronomy-themed layer on top of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines:
clarity, deference, depth, system typography, SF Symbols, native controls,
and iOS 26 Liquid Glass surfaces.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Clarity Before Decoration

Users are astronomy enthusiasts, not beginners. The UI assumes familiarity with photography concepts (aperture, shutter speed, ISO).
Labels should be concise, values should be easy to scan, and symbols
should come from SF Symbols unless a domain-specific asset is required.

**Good:**

```
[1.5]  [●]  [10]
 ⏱️     ✨   📷
```

**Bad:**

```
Exposure Time: 1.5 seconds
Capture Button
Number of Shots: 10
```

### 2. Deference To Content

Astrophotography content, camera preview, stacked results, and dark-sky
map tiles are the primary surfaces. Chrome should support those surfaces
without competing with them:

- prefer native navigation, tab, search, list, sheet, and button patterns
- avoid nested cards and heavy custom backgrounds
- use text only when icons and values are not enough
- keep the tab bar stable for global navigation

### 3. Native Depth

iOS 26 Liquid Glass is the default depth language for cards, pills,
buttons, and floating controls. Use native `glassEffect`, glass button
styles, and `GlassEffectContainer` through the design-system helpers.

### 4. Continuous Corners Where Custom Shapes Are Needed

All UI elements use continuous corner radii (iOS 13+ style) for visual consistency.

```swift
// Always
.continuousCorners(CornerRadius.lg)

// Never
.cornerRadius(16)
.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16))
```

### 5. Wheel Pickers Over Sliders

Camera controls use iOS-native wheel pickers (like Clock app) instead of sliders. This provides:

- Precise value selection
- Familiar iOS interaction pattern
- Better accessibility
- Cleaner visual hierarchy

### 6. Async/Await Throughout

All long-running operations (capture, stacking, file I/O) use Swift concurrency:

- No completion handlers
- Structured concurrency with Task
- Actor isolation for image processing
- Progress reporting via @Published properties

## System Architecture

### Layer Separation

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  App (StakkaApp, Root, Composition)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domains/*/Presentation                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domains/*/Application                      │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**App Layer**

- Tab navigation
- Dependency composition via `AppContainer`
- Dark mode enforcement

**Domain Layer**

- Business capabilities are grouped by domain: `DarkSky`, `Capture`, `Stacking`, `Library`, `Session`
- Each domain can contain `Presentation`, `Application`, `Domain`, and `Infrastructure`
- Shared business capabilities (for example stacking) are reused through use cases and protocols instead of direct feature-to-feature calls

**Platform Layer**

- Design system tokens and shared view modifiers
- Localization wrappers and shared formatters
- Shared lightweight utility types
- Cross-domain support services

### Domain Module Pattern

Each business domain follows this shape:

```
Domains/{Domain}/
├── Presentation/                # SwiftUI views + view models
├── Application/                 # Use cases / orchestration
├── Domain/                      # Entities, value objects, protocols
└── Infrastructure/              # Framework adapters / platform IO
```

Presentation:

- `View` and `ViewModel`
- UI state and transitions
- No direct platform framework setup beyond rendering

Application:

- Coordinates domain operations
- Exposes task-oriented entry points such as `RunStackingUseCase`

Domain:

- Stable business models and protocols
- Avoids view concerns

Infrastructure:

- AVFoundation, CoreImage, PhotoKit, CoreLocation, MapKit integration
- Concrete implementations for domain protocols

## Core Subsystems

### 1. Camera Capture System

**Components:**

- `CameraViewModel` — AVFoundation session management
- `CameraView` — Preview layer + controls overlay
- `CameraControlsView` — Orchestrates pickers and menu
- `AdvancedControlsMenu` — Drag-to-expand advanced settings
- `WheelPickerView` — Generic wheel picker overlay

**Flow:**

1. User taps exposure/shots button → Wheel picker appears
2. User drags menu up → Advanced controls expand (aperture, shutter, zoom, mode)
3. User taps capture → Sequential capture begins
4. The active camera repository applies supported exposure and zoom settings before each still capture
5. Each captured frame is queued to the live stacking session through an `AsyncStream`
6. Progress updates via `@Published captureProgress`
7. Live stack preview/count/exposure update through `@Published` snapshot state after the stack queue processes frames
8. The live-built `StackingProject` is saved as the recent library project

**Key Constraints:**

- Camera permission required (AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess)
- Capture session runs on background queue
- UI updates on main actor
- Exposure time: 0.1-30s
- Shot count: 2-100
- Capture cadence is decoupled from live-stack processing
- Aperture and shooting-mode controls are presets/readouts; custom exposure duration and zoom are applied where supported by AVFoundation

### 2. Image Stacking Algorithm

**Implementation:**

- Actor-isolated for thread safety
- Project-based workflow: analyze → register → stack
- Frame model includes `Light`, `Dark`, `Flat`, `Dark Flat`, `Bias`
- Vision-based homographic registration with translational fallback for enabled light frames
- Multiple light combine modes: average, median, kappa-sigma, median kappa-sigma, maximum
- Optional DSS-style comet workflow: standard, comet-only, comet+stars
- Live stacking session for camera frames reusing the same analyzer, registration, and mode mapping
- Downsampled incremental live preview accumulator for capture-time responsiveness; final project stacking still uses the full image pipeline
- Async/await for non-blocking execution

**Performance:**

- Imported frames are normalized and downscaled before processing
- Linear RGBA buffers are used for calibration and combine
- Returns `UIImage` for in-app preview and photo-library save

### 2.1 Library Project Workflow

The library tab now behaves like a stacking project editor instead of a one-off picker:

- each frame is assigned to a group
- project state is held in `StackingProject`
- analysis and registration results are written back into the same project model
- UI renders the project as grouped sections plus a recap/result area
- projects are stored in a local project catalog and one project is restored as recent on launch
- final results can be saved to Photos or exported as TIFF
- comet annotations are persisted with the project and reviewed in a dedicated full-screen flow

### 2.2 Project Catalog

Stacking projects are no longer stored as a single recent blob. The current storage model is:

- local project catalog under app storage
- one directory per project
- per-project frame cache
- explicit recent-project pointer

This enables:

- project browsing
- project duplication
- project deletion
- camera capture handoff into a real project instead of an in-memory queue

### 3. Design System

**Tokens:**

- Colors: Space theme with a single app accent (`appAccent`) plus limited domain/data palettes
- Typography: SF Pro with rounded variant for numbers
- Spacing: 4/8/16/24/32/48pt scale
- Corner radii: 6/10/16/20/28/36pt (continuous style)
- Animations: Spring/smooth/quick presets

**Key Modifiers:**

- `.continuousCorners(_:)` — Continuous corner radii
- `.glassCard()` — Frosted glass effect
- `.glow(color:radius:)` — Static glow
- `.breathingGlow(color:radius:)` — Animated glow

**Animation Presets:**

```swift
AnimationPreset.spring        // 0.4s, 75% damping
AnimationPreset.springBouncy  // 0.5s, 65% damping
AnimationPreset.smooth        // 0.35s ease in/out
AnimationPreset.quick         // 0.2s ease out
AnimationPreset.gentle        // 0.5s ease in/out
```

### Localization

User-facing copy no longer lives directly in SwiftUI views.

- `Platform/SharedKernel/L10n.swift` holds semantic keys and phrase helpers
- `Platform/SharedKernel/L10nFormat.swift` centralizes locale-sensitive formatting such as decimals, durations, coordinates, and generated project titles
- `*.lproj/Localizable.strings` contains translated UI copy
- `*.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` contains permission copy

This keeps primary screens free of raw localization keys and prevents mixed-language UI strings from drifting across modules.

### 4. Light Pollution Map

**Components:**

- MapKit integration
- Location services
- Pollution level classification (9 levels)
- Interactive markers

**Data Source:**

- Mock data currently
- Future: Light Pollution Map API integration

## Current Product Baseline

At the current codebase state:

- library projects are the main production workflow
- comet modes are implemented for library projects
- camera capture live-stacks frames and hands the resulting project into the recent project
- TIFF export exists for final outputs
- RAW/FITS import and intermediate exports are still pending

## State Management

### ViewModel Pattern

All ViewModels follow this structure:

```swift
@MainActor
class FeatureViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // Published state
    @Published var property: Type = defaultValue
    
    // Private dependencies
    private let dependency: Dependency
    
    // Public commands
    func performAction() async {
        // Business logic
    }
}
```

### State Flow

```
User Interaction
    ↓
View calls ViewModel method
    ↓
ViewModel updates @Published properties
    ↓
SwiftUI re-renders affected views
```

No global state. No singletons. Each feature owns its state.

## Dependency Management

### Current: Zero Dependencies

Stakka uses only iOS system frameworks:

- SwiftUI
- AVFoundation
- MapKit
- PhotosUI
- CoreImage
- CoreGraphics

### Future Considerations

If adding dependencies:

- Use Swift Package Manager
- Prefer Apple frameworks over third-party
- Justify each dependency in PR description
- Keep dependency count minimal

## Testing Strategy

### Current State

Manual testing on simulator and device.

### Future Testing

- Unit tests for ImageStacker algorithm
- UI tests for camera capture flow
- Snapshot tests for design system components
- Performance tests for stacking large image sets

## Build System

### XcodeGen

Project file is generated from `project.yml`:

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

Benefits:

- No merge conflicts in .xcodeproj
- Declarative project structure
- Easy to review changes

### Build Configurations

- Debug: Development builds
- Release: App Store builds

## Performance Considerations

### Image Stacking

- Processes images asynchronously
- Uses actor isolation to prevent data races
- Memory-efficient (processes one pixel at a time)
- Scales to 100+ images

### Camera Capture

- AVFoundation session runs on background queue
- UI updates throttled to 60fps
- Preview layer uses hardware acceleration

### UI Rendering

- SwiftUI automatic optimization
- Lazy loading for image grids
- Continuous corner radii use Metal acceleration

## Security & Privacy

### Permissions Required

- Camera access (AVCaptureDevice)
- Photo library access (PhotosPicker)
- Location access (MapKit, optional)

### Data Storage

- No cloud storage
- All data local to device
- No analytics or tracking
- No third-party SDKs

## Localization

### Current State

UI text is minimal and primarily Chinese.

### Future Localization

- Extract strings to Localizable.strings
- Support English, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)
- Use SF Symbols (language-agnostic)

## Accessibility

### Current State

- System font scaling supported
- VoiceOver labels on interactive elements
- High contrast colors (space theme)

### Future Improvements

- VoiceOver testing
- Dynamic Type support
- Reduce Motion support for animations

## Known Limitations

1. **Light pollution data** — Currently mock data, needs API integration
2. **Auto-stacking** — Camera captures images but doesn't auto-stack yet
3. **Export options** — Limited to saving to photo library
4. **Advanced camera controls** — Aperture/shutter/ISO are UI-only (not wired to AVFoundation)

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Potential Additions

1. **Core Data** — If adding saved locations or capture presets
2. **Combine** — If adding reactive data streams beyond @Published
3. **WidgetKit** — For home screen light pollution widget
4. **CloudKit** — For syncing favorite locations across devices

### Architectural Principles to Maintain

- Keep features independent
- Maintain zero third-party dependencies if possible
- Preserve async/await throughout
- Continue minimal text philosophy
- Maintain design system consistency
